## 1. Just because a system has great reviews doesn’t mean it’s right for you.

[2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/) and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) are the two task management apps I’ve used the longest, but there came a point where I dropped the ball with each of them. I also tried plain text task management apps like [Swiftodo](https://swiftodoapp.com/desktop/) and spent a fair bit of time trying to follow the [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) system religiously.

[Getting Things Done](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563) (GTD) by David Allen was my bible for a time, but I could never keep up with the weekly reviews.

**Each of these was like a suit made for someone else. Looked stunning on the model, but pinched when I tried it on straight from the hanger.**

### Try this:
_When everyone is raving about an app or a system, find out who “everyone” is. What do they have in common? Does that sound like you? If you’re a trapezoidal peg, don’t force yourself into a pentagonal hole._

## 2. If you can’t organize your day on paper, an app won’t help.

Physical lists have done the job for the most brilliant minds since lists were a thing. They did the same for my friends and me, prior to the digital age. Not having an alternative, we wrote out our lists and re-wrote them when needed, which was often.

**It was enormously freeing to realize that while apps can be helpful tools, they aren’t vital**. I won’t die without them, and I might just be better off without them from time to time.

### Try this:
_Take a plain piece of paper and write the three most important things you need to get done tomorrow. If anything else comes up during the day, write it under your list of three things._

---
## 3. System-Hopping won’t change what’s stopping you from completing your tasks.

The excitement I felt when changing systems came from actually doing _something_ while procrastinating what I should have been doing. Seeing my tasks from a fresh perspective gave me a euphoric high. That feeling became a drug.

Beware the trap of [productivity porn](https://nesslabs.com/productivity-porn).

### Try this:
_Go on a week-long app-detox. Write your lists on paper (keep it simple), or create plain text lists that any text editor can read._

---

## 4. You Have a Productivity Style: Work With It, Not Against It

If a [rustic cottage garden](https://www.pinterest.com.au/waterfieldfox2/rustic-cottage-style-gardens/) appeals to you more than a [neatly trimmed suburban garden](https://www.pinterest.com.au/search/pins/?q=landscape%20front%20yard&rs=typed&term_meta[]=landscape%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=front%7Ctyped&term_meta[]=yard%7Ctyped) or the [palace gardens at Versailles](http://en.chateauversailles.fr/discover/estate/gardens), your planning style may have similar qualities. I see Omnifocus in the Versailles category, 2Do and Things as suburban gardens, and plain text lists as the rambling cottage garden.

### Try this:
_Make a list of everything you want a task management app to do for you. Put a star next to the functions you couldn’t do almost as easily with pencil and paper._

## Summary

1.  Just because a system has great reviews doesn’t mean it’s right for you. _Do your research._
2.  If you can’t organize your projects on paper, an app won’t help. _Write your to-do list on paper or with plain text._
3.  System-hopping won’t change what’s stopping you from completing tasks. _Go on a week-long app detox._
4.  You have a productivity style: work with it, not against it. _Write down what you need from an app._

Remembering these four truths can help you break free from shiny object syndrome, and focus on doing and experiencing. On living life, instead of constantly chasing a better way to plan.
